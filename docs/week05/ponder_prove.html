      <h1>Your Task</h1>
      <section>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          You have so many friends that you have a hard time keeping track of them. &#128521; Create a stateful process that tracks your amazing and abundant friends.
        </p>

        Before beginning this Task, make sure you have reviewed the
            <a href="../week05/" target="_blank">stateful processes</a>
            course content.

        <h3>The Process</h3>
        <h4>Complete the following steps</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a module that has a <kbd>run/1</kbd> function that tracks the names of your friends.</li>
          <li>
            In the same module, write a <kbd>start/0</kbd> function that spawns the <kbd>run/1</kbd> function as a process and returns the the process' PID.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the same module as the <kbd>run/1</kbd> function, write a client function that sends friend status change messages to the process and waits for a response.
          </li>
          <li>
            Write the <kbd>run/1</kbd> function in such a way that, based on which message it receives, a friend can be added, removed, a check can be done to see if someone is your friend, or a list of your current friends can be retrieved. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure that unrecognized messages are also dealt with in such a way that the process doesn't crash.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>The Testing Driver</h3>
        <h4>Complete the following steps</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Create a separate module containing a testing driver function, <kbd>driver/0</kbd>, that spawns at least two processes for the module and uses the modules' client functions. The testing driver function must make multiple calls to the <kbd>rpc</kbd> function. Make the driver interesting by adding, removing, and checking friends. Add at least 1,000 friends. Also include sending unrecognizable messages to the process.
          </li>
          <li>
            From within the REPL, run <kbd>driver/0</kbd> and observe the results.
          </li>
        </ol>
        
  <section>
      <h3>Review</h3>
      <h4>After completing the previous steps:</h4>
      <ol>
          <li>Review one of the many <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse121e-course/week05/provided_solution.zip">possible solutions</a> for this task,</li>
          <li>Compare and contrast your code with the possible solutions&rsquo; code, and</li>
          <li>Make note of any improvements you could make for future tasks.</li>
      </ol>
  </section>
        
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Stretch (optional)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a modified version of your solution so that the friend process runs in one instance of the erl REPL and the client in a separate erl REPL instance on the same machine.
          </li>
          <li>
            Explore how to run the client on one machine and the spawned process on another. Create a modified version of you code to do so.
          </li>
        </ol>
