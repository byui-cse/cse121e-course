	<h1>gen_servers</h1>
	<p>
		Erlang's generic server, <kbd>gen_server</kbd> is an interesting thing. Instead of writing a server from scratch, you can leverage existing <kbd>gen_server</kbd>
		behavior. When you do so, you reduce the number of bugs you will create, simplify your code, and dramatically reduce the amount of code you write. All 
		of these are great reasons to use the <kbd>gen_server</kbd> behavior.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you choose to use the <kbd>gen_server</kbd> behavior, you agree to a contract. You must implement specific functions in specific ways so the existing <kbd>gen_server</kbd> code can do what you want it to. It is generic, after all, and you must provide it the functions that allow it to do what YOU want. 
		Supplying these functions is much like passing a <kbd>fun</kbd> to the 
		<kbd>lists:map/2</kbd> BIF. Like <kbd>gen_server</kbd>, the <kbd>lists:map/2</kbd> BIF is generic. You provide the <kbd>fun</kbd> that specializes it 
		so it does the mapping the way you want.
	</p>
		Additionally, you must supply the client code used to access the <kbd>gen_server's</kbd> generic behaviors.
		In last week's learning, you saw how a client can be in the same module and yet be run separately from a server. Having the rpc client-code in the same module is not a requirement for a client You could put it in a separate module should you choose to. However when you use the <kbd>gen_server</kbd> behavior available to you via Erlang, you do NOT separate the client code from the server code.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each <kbd>gen_server</kbd> is a process. Therefore, when you want the <kbd>gen_server</kbd> to execute something, you have to use specific functions just like 
		you would with any other servers. We will look at 2 of these functions. There are others.
	</p>
		<h2>gen_server:call/2</h2>
		<p>
			When you want to make a synchronous call and wait for a response use the <kbd>gen_server:call/2</kbd> function or one of its variants. the  
			<kbd>gen_server:call/2</kbd> has 2 parameters.
			<ol>
				<li>ServerRef - the name of the server to use (It's ID), and</li>
				<li>Request - this is usually a tuple similar to what you saw last week. It usually contains an atom that is a command, and some data to work with.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>Last week, you saw how to create a custom server that could multiply or add up a list of numbers, or divide two numbers. The tuple passed to the server by the client code looked 
			like this,
		</p>
		<p>
		<pre>
		<code>{add,[1,2,3]}. <!-- no need to declare Erlang as the code type here. It's done at the top of this page for all code in this page.-->
</code></pre></p>
		<p>
			like this,
		</p>
		<p>
		<pre>
		<code>{multiply,[1,2,3]}. 
</code></pre></p>
		<p>
			or, like this.
		</p>
		<p>
		<pre>
		<code>{divide,23,5}.
</code></pre></p>
		<p>
			The example in this reading is going to show you how to implement this same, simple, server using the <kbd>gen_server</kbd> behavior so you can focus on 
			the behavior and how to use it rather than getting caught up in the code for some server that does something other than these simple arithmetic functions. It will also allow you to compare and contrast 
			the two servers types of servers to help you understand the basics of <kbd>gen_server</kbd>.
		</p>
		<p>
			So what would a call to the existing <kbd>gen_server:call/2</kbd> function look like that would, when the rest of the server is complete, 
			add up a list of numbers?
		</p>
		<p>
		<pre>
		<code>gen_server:call(?MODULE,{add,[1,2,3]}. 
</code></pre></p>
		<p>
			There it is. Done. There is one strange thing there you haven't seen before. The <kbd>gen_server:call/2</kbd> function is being used in client code. 
			Remember, earlier you read that client code is usually written in the same module as the server code? The <kbd>?MODULE</kbd> statement make use of that. 
			The statement <kbd>?MODULE</kbd> is of type <kbd>macro</kbd> and evaluates to the name of the module the call to <kbd>gen_server:call/2</kbd> happens in. 
			Last week, the server was in the module <kbd>simp_calc</kbd>. This week, let's put the code for the <kbd>gen_server</kbd> version in a module called 
			<kbd>calcs</kbd>. That means <kbd>?MODULE</kbd> will be converted to <kbd>calcs</kbd> at compile time. It's handy to use this instead of writing 
			<kbd>calcs</kbd> in your code. That way, if you decide to change the name of the module, all the client code is updated for you. &#128526;
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's embed this piece of code in a client function that can be used outside of the server with any list of numbers.
		</p>
		<p>
		<pre>
		<code>sum_of(List)->gen_server:call(?MODULE,{add,List}). 
</code></pre></p>
		<p>
			Multiplication? No problem.
		</p>
		<p>
		<pre>
		<code>product_of(List)->gen_server:call(?MODULE,{multiply,List}). 
</code></pre></p>
		<p>
			Division? Easy.
		</p>
		<p>
		<pre>
		<code>quotient_of(Dividend,Divisor)->gen_server:call(?MODULE,{divide,Dividend,Divisor}). 
</code></pre></p>
		<p>
			Using these client functions also requires very little code and, hopefully, is easy for those who are using your server to use.&#128512;
		</p>

		<p>
		<pre>
		<code>calcs:sum_of([1,2,3,4,5]. 
</code></pre></p>
		<p>
			Look at that! They don't even know you are using a server or that it's running in a separate process! That's the way you want your 
			code to be for those who use it.&#129395;
		</p>
		<h2>gen_server:cast/2</h2>
		<p>
			The <kbd>gen_server:cast/2</kbd> function can be used for asynchronous calls. But these are a specific type of asynchronous call. Use 
			<kbd>cast/2</kbd> when you want to throw something at a server and don't particularly care if it arrives, if the server actually 
			exists, or if the data is dispensable, and you are not expecting any kind of response. 
			This function has similar behavior to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_multicast"> IP 
			multicast networking protocol</a>. As someone new to Erlang, you should probably avoid using <kbd>gen_server:cast/2</kbd>. I've 
			included it here, because you will see it being used in online examples. Many of those are misusing <kbd>gen_server:cast/2</kbd>.
		</p>
		<h2>Handling Calls</h2>
		<p>
			So far you've seen how to make a call. Now it's time to see how to handle an incoming call using <kbd>gen_server</kbd> behavior. 
			To do so, write all needed <kbd>handle_call/3</kbd> function clauses in your module. The <kbd>gen_server</kbd> behavior will use pattern matching 
			to call the appropriate clause of the <kbd>handle_call</kbd> function you write. We could write a single-clause <kbd>handle_call/3</kbd> 
			function but, as mentioned last week, that would be a bit weird. Let's follow a pattern similar to the one from last week...create 
			a function clause to handle each type of command.
		</p>
		<p>
		<pre>
		<code>handle_call({add,List},_From,State) ->
	{reply,
		lists:foldl(fun(X,Accum)->Accum+X end,0,List),
	State};%% not modifying the server's internal state

handle_call({multiply,List},_From,State) -> 
	{reply,
		lists:foldl(fun(X,Accum)->Accum*X end, 1,List),
	State};%% not modifying the server's internal state
handle_call({divide,Left,Right},_From,State) -> 
	{reply,
		Left div Right,
	State};%% not modifying the server's internal state
handle_call(stop, _From, _State) -> 
	{stop,normal,
		server_stopped,
    down}. %% setting the server's internal state to down
</code></pre></p>
		<p>
			Imagine you wanted to add more commands that worked on lists. Maybe things like <kbd>mean</kbd>, <kbd>median</kbd>, or <kbd>mode</kbd>. You would then 
			add a new <kbd>handle_call/3</kbd> clause with the additional needed behavior and a client function that calls the clause you just created.
		</p>
		<p>
			Imagine if you needed to add more commands with some number of parameters. The parameters might be numbers. They might be strings. Or they might be anything. Again, you would add a <kbd>handle_call/3</kbd> clause and an appropriate client function.
		</p>
		<p>
			In any of these cases, the correct <kbd>handle_call</kbd> clause will get called by the <kbd>gen_server</kbd>.
		</p>
		<h2>The Full Code Set</h2>
		<p>
			There are some other functions that need to be added to the <kbd>calcs</kbd> module to meet the contract with the <kbd>gen_server</kbd> behavior. We won't 
			go over them all yet, but here is the 'just enough' code to get the <kbd>calcs</kbd> module running, including documentation comments that <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/apps/edoc/chapter.html">EDoc</a> can use to generate documentation web pages.

		There is a MAJOR design flaw in the code above. Because each of these behaviors is part of this <kbd>gen_server</kbd>, when a request with a seemingly large list, say 100,000,000 numbers, is sent, all other requests to this server will have to queue up. Now you've not created something that is concurrent. OOPS!! 
	</p>
	<p>
		Another problem is if one of the behaviors causes a crash, like asking divide to divide by zero, any request that has been queued will fail. OOPS!! Once again, not concurrent and certainly not stable.
	</p>
	<p>
		Don't worry. Your task this week will include changing this bad design and re-implement a solution in order to solve these problems. You'll find more information about this in the task.
	</p>

	<h1>Supervisors</h1>
	<p>
		There are many different ways to classify software defects. Each Quality Assurance (QA) team will use a scheme created by the company they are a part of. An interesting way to classify them is to start by putting them into two large groupings, those that can be made to happen consistantly and those that can not. Let's lable these as 'Consistant' and 'Erratic.' This is an easy enough grouping to get our heads around.
	</p>
	<h2>Consistant Defects</h2>
	<p>
		This type of defect comes in two flavors, serious and superficial. Superficial defects are those that do exist, but don't effect the use of the product. These can be things like colors or fonts being incorrect in a Graphical User Interface (GUI) type application or even numerical calculations that are done incorrectly but don't effect the overall computed result in such a way that the total computed answer is significantly wrong. Whether to fix these types of defects comes down to a business decision. This decision is usually based around estimates of how much the fix will cost in developer and testing time, which customers the defect, or its change, may effect, and if there are other defects that are considered more important. This decision is not usually made by programmers or engineers.
	</p>
	<p>
		Consistant serious defects directly effect the result of using the software. They may be numerical calculations that are egregiously wrong. They may be engineering defects that make the software so slow that it becomes unusable. They may be the result of poor coding that causes the application to hang or crash. These types of defects should always be fixed. They are readily detectible. Their cause is relatively easy to reproduce and therefore pin-point their cause. Company policy should be that programmers and engineers should fix any of these that are found without guidance from management. However, not all defects are so easy to pin-point.
	</p>
	<h2>Erratic Defects</h2>
	<p>
		Erratic defects occur occasionally and can be very difficult or impossible to reproduce. Their causes usually have something to do with poor engineering and/or programming. The cause may be poor decisions made when doing manual memory allocation and dealocation as is done in C, C++, and other similar languages. The cause may also be poor decisions made regarding concurrency. In many languages it is possible to share changable data between concurrent operations. This causes a defect called a race condition. When such a defect is created, it means that none of the operations involved can count on the data value being correct or even reasonable. It is not uncommon, when trying to fix a race condition, that another type of defect is created. It is called a deadlock or cross-lock. When this defect is in the code, the programm will SOMETIMES lock up but not always. But when trying to reproduce the defect, the execution happens in some other order and so the programm doesn't lock up. The question is, what should be done with these types of defects?
	</p>
	<p>
		I, the author, used to work on a piece of software that controlled the planning and scheduling of semiconductor factories. If the software crashed, the factory using the software could loose millions of dollars per hour. That's why crashing was completely unacceptable. The software is written in C++ and uses a lot of manual memory allocation and deallocation. There was an erratic crash happening in the software. In fact, it had only happened once. I was given the task of finding the defect and fixing it. I was given a crash report that was helpful as a starting point. It showed where in the code the crash happened. When I looked in the software, there was no direct reason there should have been a crash at that point. That's when I knew we were in trouble.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a senior engineer, it took me 4 days to track down and fix the problem. There was a shared piece of data used in several places in the non-concurrent application. In one place where it had been used but was no longer needed, the memory for the data was released to be reused. The other variables for that piece of data would continue to use the data. Eventually, the system would decide to reuse the data's old memory. Now when the remaining variables tried to read it, the data would be corrupt and the application would crash. This type of defect is called 'use-after-free.' We called it a zombie pointer. It would seem to be alive, but was actually dead.&#129503;
	</p>
	<p>
		This type of defect is very expensive to fix if it can be tracked down at all. Thankfully, Erlang doesn't require or allow manual memory management. That means use-after-free defects can't be created. Also, since Erlang is a functional programming language, you can't create either of the concurrency defects either.&#x1F60E;&#129395;
	</p>
	<p>
		That does NOT mean that your Erlang code can never crash. A simple example of a crash in Erlang is division by zero. If your <kbd>gen_server</kbd> code has an accidental division by zero in a case that gets called sometimes. You have a problem. Now division by zero errors are easy to track down. Other erratic defects and crashes due to bad engineering or programming decisions when using Erlang can be just as hard to track down and fix as the defects mentioned earlier. The question is, should we fix these erratic, serious defects? The answer is a resounding NO! There is an Erlang way to deal with these.
	</p>
	<h1>Supervisors</h1>
	<p>
		Tracking down and fixing such ugly bugs often causes other, new defects. When you are thinking Erlangy you will avoid creating these new bugs by using supervisors. What these supervisors do is manage a bunch of gen_servers and if one detects that a gen_server has crashed it can restart it and report the restart. That is referred to as <kbd>one_for_one</kbd> supervision in the Erlang community. Another type of supervision is called <kbd>one_for_all</kbd>. In this type of supervision, a supervisor is managing several related <kbd>gen_server</kbd>s and, when one crashes, the supervisor terminates all of the related <kbd>gen_server</kbd>s and then restarts them all.
	</p>
	<p>
		This <a href="https://ferd.ca/the-zen-of-erlang.html">Let it Crash</a> approach needs to be carefully understood. It doesn't mean that you let your whole application crash or become unusable. If that's the case, you've got much more serious problems. What it does mean is this. You are human. You will make mistakes when designing applications and writing code. Any of the consistant, serious defects you create must be fixed. Yet, in spite of your best efforts to do an excellent job and create great code, you will always flub up.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because of this, design your Erlang processes and <kbd>gen_servers</kbd> to be small and independent. That way if one crashes it can not take down the whole system. As part of the process of designing and creating your application, design and create a supervisor tree. In other words, have small, independent supervisors that supervise related processes and <kbd>gen_servers</kbd>. Then have small, independent supervisors that supervise related supervisors. Eventually, you have a top-level supervisor at the root of the tree. 
	</p>
	<p>
		When you design and create the supervisor tree well, your application can have nearly 100% uptime for YEARS!! Yes. That means it can effectively never crash! Also, if you do a good design and creation job, you can update your software without shutting it off again leading to near 100% uptimes!!!&#x1F60E;&#129395;&#129395;&#129395;&#129395;&#129395;
	</p>
	<p>
		For this class, you won't be learning how to build the entire tree. Let's save that for later. Instead, focus your energy on learning how to do an amazing job of creating <kbd>one_for_one</kbd> and <kbd>one_for_all</kbd> supervisors for <kbd>gen_servers</kbd>. This is the lowest level of the supervision tree upon which the rest of the tree is built. Supervisor supervisors (there's a fun one to say a bunch of times quickly &#128512;) will follow a similar pattern. So expect to see this kind of thing again.
	</p>
	<h2>A Minimal Supervisor</h2>
	<p>
		Here is some code you can use as a template when you create a supervisor (notice the <kbd>-behavior(supervisor)</kbd> line of code). We won't go into detail regarding all the supervisor functions in this class, but expect to in later classes.&#128512; Some of these functions look very similar to those found in a <kbd>gen_server</kbd>. That's the principle of concept reuse. What a great concept!&#128512; However, the most important thing to understand in the code below is what's happening in the <kbd>init/1</kbd> function.
	</p>
	<p>
		While there are many things you can do in <kbd>init/1</kbd>, what you see below is code that defines the behavior of the supervisor. Notice that the supervisor is going to use the <kbd>one_for_one</kbd> management scheme discussed earlier. Directly after that line of code is a list of all the modules the supervisor starts up and manages. In this case, the list only has one tuple in it describing one <kbd>gen_server</kbd>, <kbd>calcs</kbd>. Look in the code comments for the meanings of each of the parts of the supervised module definition.

		It is now running in its own process and has the <kbd>calcs gen_server</kbd> running in a seperate process. You are ready to go! Now use it to add all the numbers from 1 to 1,000,000 inclusive. Notice that you call the <kbd>calcs</kbd> module directly, not through the supervisor. The job of the supervisor does not include distribution of tasks or requests.

		Not let's see what happens when you try to divide by zero. What should happen, according to the instructions in the <kbd>init/1</kbd> function of <kbd>calcs_supervisor</kbd>, is a crash report including the cause of the crash will be printed out and then <kbd>calcs</kbd> should be restarted. Look out, its going to be a lot of lines of error message but when something crashes, more is better than less. I'm including the whole thing here below.

		If the supervisor restarted <kbd>calcs</kbd> it should be usable right now without starting anything back up. Let's give it a try.

	<h2>Wrap Up</h2>
	<p>
		So there you have it. While there is a LOT more that can be done using <kbd>gen_server</kbd> and <kbd>supervisor</kbd> behaviors and a lot more yet to learn, these are the basics; the minimum needed to get a parallel system to work and run. Remember, however, that this design has the defects in it you read about earlier. Check out your task for this week for information on how to change the design to remove those defects.
	</p>
	<p>
		Congratulations. You've now seen how to use Erlang. Now it's up to you to build on this foundation and do some amazing, wonderful things.
