	<h1>A Project</h1>
	<p>Now it's time to combine what you've been learning with what you have been learning in your classes for your major. 
	Brainstorm and create a small project that may take about three hours to complete.</p>
	<p>Your interests should drive the selection of what you do for this project. Selecting something interesting to you 
	will aid you in completing the project and doing it well.</p>
  <p>
    If you want to show your prowess in pulling JSON data from a remote site, like you did in week05, a good choice would 
    be to use <a href="https://www.mocky.io" target="_blank">mocky.io</a> to store your JSON data and serve it up. The 
    mocky.io service stores your JSON data and provides you with a URL that you can use to retrieve it in your code.
