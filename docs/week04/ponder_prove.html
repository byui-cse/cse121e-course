      <h1>Your Task</h1>
      <section>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          What you want to accomplish with this task is to solve a design problem. In the reading example, you can run a bunch of computations in a process, but if one request causes a crash, it takes everything down. This means that everyone else using that process for computations has a request fail. This is not good.
          As part of this redesign, you will want to use the Erlang programming principles learned earlier in the class to write easily read, understood, and, therefore, easily maintained code.
        </p>

        Before beginning this Task, make sure you have reviewed the
            <a href="../week04/" target="_blank">concurrent programming</a>
            course content.

        <h3>The Process</h3>
        <h4>Complete the following steps</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a module that has a process providing factorial for its functionality.</li>
          <li>
            In the same module as the factorial function, write a <kbd>start/0</kbd> function that spawns the factorial function as a process and returns the factorial process' PID.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the same module as the factorial function, write a client function that sends an integer to the factorial process and waits for a response.
          </li>
          <li>
            Divide up the <kbd>simple_calc</kbd> module into three distinct modules, each with one of the calculation behaviors. Include in each module a client function similar to the one from simple_calc.  
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>The Testing Driver</h3>
        <h4>Complete the following steps</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Create a separate module containing a testing driver function, <kbd>driver/0</kbd>, that spawns at least two processes for each of the four modules created earlier. The <kbd>driver/0</kbd> function must use the modules' client functions. It must call each client function 1000 times. Make it interesting by asking for the results from interesting numbers. Also include sending unrecognizable messages to each of the for process types.
          </li>
          <li>
            From within the REPL, run <kbd>driver/0</kbd> and observe the results.
          </li>
        </ol>
        
  <section>
      <h3>Review</h3>
      <h4>After completing the previous steps:</h4>
      <ol>
          <li>Review one of the many <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse121e-course/week04/provided_solution.zip">possible solutions</a> for this task,</li>
          <li>Compare and contrast your code with the possible solutions&rsquo; code, and</li>
          <li>Make note of any improvements you could make for future tasks.</li>
      </ol>
  </section>
        
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Stretch (optional)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a modified version of your solution so that the factorial process runs in one instance of the erl REPL and the client in a separate erl REPL instance on one machine.
          </li>
          <li>
            Explore how to run the client on one machine and the factorial process on another. Create a modified version of you code to do so.
          </li>
        </ol>
