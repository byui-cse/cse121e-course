	<h1>Beyond Sequential</h1>
	<p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sequential"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"></a> Sequential computing is a good thing. It's easy to think about. It's easy to debug. It's lots of good things.But 
		there is something it isn't good at. It can't maximize the computing power of a multi-core computer. And since 
		<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/moores-law-is-dead-nvidias-ceo-jensen-huang-says-at-ces-2019/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer">Moore's law is dead</a>, we programmers and software engineers can't rely on hardware speed ups to make our applications 
          run faster...or can we? &#129320;
      </p>
      <p>
      	These days, we can get our applications to run faster by splitting them across multiple cores. But how do we make that happen? 
      	We make it happen by doing <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/concurrent"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer">concurrent</a> programming and software design instead of sequential programming and software design. 
      	That way, we can run our application on multiple cores or on multiple distinct computers, or both, and have our app do 
      	many, and even massively many, things at the same time!
      </p>
      <p>
      	But wait a minute, you think. "There has to be a penalty to pay, right?" No! There is no penalty to pay if the language you are using was 
      	designed to make concurrent programming MUCH easier. Now, if you are thinking of using other languages that were not designed to make 
      	concurrent programming easier (yes I'm looking at you C, C++, JavaScript, Clojure, and many, many others) then there is all kinds of nastiness you have to deal 
      	with.
      	</p> 
      	<p>
      		But Erlang was specifically designed for concurrent programming. Because of that, the biggest traps programmers fall into when they 
      	write concurrent applications, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34510/what-is-a-race-condition"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer">race conditions</a> and <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~milom/cis501-Fall10/lectures/09_multicore-4up.pdf">cross locks</a>, are impossible to create in Erlang. That's great! You probably have never created these monsters and had to try to fix them, 
          so you might not appreciate not falling in a trap 
          that no longer exists (in Erlang at least). Yet, because of Erlang, you application will never 'lock up'. Every time any app you've used locks up, it is a cross lock 
          bug in the code. Think how often you've experienced that as a user. Wow! We programmers have GOT to do a better job.
      </p>
      <p>
      	You may have heard of threads and how hard it is to write multi-threaded code. Don't fuss about it. Erlang doesn't have you create threads at all. 
      	Erlang let's you create Erlang processes. Now, please don't misunderstand. These are not operating system processes (seperate running applictions). The 
      	creators of Erlang were much smarter than to fall back on that 1970's approach. They did something very different.
      </p>
      <h2>Processes</h2>
      	<p>
      		Erlang processes are not the same thing as an operating system process. OS processes are things like applications and 
      		<a href="https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/daemon.html"
          		target="_blank"
          		rel="noreferrer">daemon's</a> running on your computer. One difference between OS processes running on your computer and an Erlang process is that 
          	Each OS process has its own chunk of memory. <a href="https://www.skcript.com/svr/concurrency-in-the-erlang-vm/"
          		target="_blank"
          		rel="noreferrer">Erlang processes</a> do not since they are small pieces of a single OS process all running at the same time.
      	</p>
		<p>
			The Erlang virtual machine, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEAM_(Erlang_virtual_machine)"
          		target="_blank"
          		rel="noreferrer">BEAM</a>, is highly efficient at using the OS's exposure of multiple cores through these processes. There is actually little you 
          		need to worry about as a programmer creating concurrent applications in Erlang.
		</p>
		<h3>Getting Started with Processes</h3>
		<p>
			First things first. Just like each student here at BYU-Idaho has an ID, each Erlang process has an ID, called its Proccess id (Pid). Also, Erlang uses a message passing design to 
			to accomplish concurrency. Let's look at a real-world example of ID's, message passing, and concurrency.
		</p>
		<p>
			Imagine you are working with a team for one of your classes. You are all sitting together working on a project. It becomes apparent to you that you 
			are going to have to stay a little longer to wrap things up. You had promissed to go with a friend to buy some food for a dinner they were putting 
			together, since they have very limited experience cooking compared to you. What to do? 
		</p>
		<p>
			Here is the solution you come up with. You text a another friend of yours with cooking experience who has previously voluteered to help make the 
			dinner and ask them to help your first friend purchase the groceries. You also text your friend that needs the help letting them know of the change 
			in plans. They work out the details and do the shopping while you help finish your team's project. You later get a text from each of these two 
			people. The first is from your friend who stepped in. It says they helped purchase the groceries and got everything on the list. 
			The second comes from your friend who asked for help saying the dinner is ready to start being cooked when you are.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this example, each of your friends are seperate and distinct from each other and from you. The three of you are similar to Erlang processes. 
			You accomplished what needed to be done by sending a message to each of them. They then did what needed to be done, and sent you back a message 
			reporting so. This is concurrency using processes and message passing. 
		</p>
		<p>
			There are a couple of things about this process that you haven't thought about because you use texting technology so much and so often. First, 
			in order to send your friends texts you need to know their ID. For texting, the ID you have to have is their phone number. Also, when they 
			get a text from you, they need to have your ID, phone number, so they can respond to you. If you don't sent them your ID, they can't respond, and 
			if you don't have their ID, you can't make a request.
		</p> 
		<p>
			So it turns out you use concurrency all the time in your life. Don't think because this idea is part of an Erlang class, that concurrancy and message 
			passing is more complicated than what you've seen in this example. It isn't. Don't let your brain trick you into thinking it is! All we need to do is 
			see how to convert these ideas into Erlang code. &#128515;
		</p>
		<p>
			Imagine, for a moment, that you have already created a module called <kbd>simple_calc</kbd>. It houses the code for a process that lets you do simple 
			calculator stuff like, addition, multiplication, and division. It has one function called <kbd>loop/0</kbd> that starts up the process and keeps 
			it dying. For now, don't worry about the code for the simple_calc. We'll look at that later. What we should look at first, is how to start up 
			<kbd>simple_calc</kbd>, get its Pid, and send it a message to add a list of numbers together.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's start by starting the <kbd>simple_calc</kbd> process and getting its process ID. To do this, use the <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#spawn-3"
          		target="_blank"
          		rel="noreferrer"><kbd>spawn/3</kbd></a> BIF.
		</p>
		<p>
		<pre>
		<code class="Erlang">Calc_pid = spawn(simple_calc,loop,[]).
</code></pre></p>
		<p>
			The three parameters for spawn are; 1) the module name, the name of the function to start up, and the list of parameters that function needs. 
			For this example, the name of the module is <kbd>simple_calc</kbd>, the name of the function is <kbd>loop</kbd>, and <kbd>loop</kbd> has no 
			parameters, so an empty list is passed as the last parameter. The <kbd>spawn/3</kbd> function returns the id of the process just created, so we 
			keep that in <kbd>Pid</kbd> for this example.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ok, we've got the process running. How do we send it a message? Sending messages is so fundamental to Erlang that we use an operator to send 
			messages rather than a function call. The send-message operator is <kbd>!</kbd> and messages are usually sent as tuples, so let's send a 
			message to the <kbd>simple_calc:loop/0</kbd> process asking it to add together a list of numbers for us. Now remember, just like texting, the 
			<kbd>simple_calc:loop/0</kbd> process has to have an ID to respond to, just like your texting buddies. Use the <kbd>self/0</kbd> function to 
			get the process ID of where the response should sent. Here is the code to send that message.
		</p>
		<p>
		<pre>
		<code class="Erlang">Calc_pid ! {self(),{add,[1,2,3]}}.
</code></pre></p>
		<p>
			On the left of the <kbd>!</kbd> operator you see the process ID for the process the message is being sent to. On the right it the tuple that 
			has all the parts needed so the process knows what to do. The first element of the message is the process ID where the response should be sent. 
			The seccond element is the atom telling the calculator what you want done (addition), and the third element is the list of numbers to add. You 
			can have as many elements as you need. Erlang has no requirement for the number of elements in a message, nor what they should be. If, however, 
			you start sending messages with a lot of elements, you've probably got something wrong in the design of the process. The reason we know to send 
			these three elements for this example, is we have read the documentation for the process. It told us what to send when we want to add stuff up.
		</p>
		<p>
			When this line of code runs in the REPL, you get a message like this.
		</p>
		<p>
		<pre>
		<code class="Erlang">{<0.80.0>,add,[1,2,3]}
</code></pre></p>
		<p>
			I'd bet you expected to see a 6 instead. What's up with this? Where did the 6 go? Great questions! What you are seeing is what has been done, and 
			the 6 is waiting in the queue of the REPL process for you to retrieve it. Think about texting your friends again. Usually when you send a text, 
			you get some sort of message like 'sent' after you tell the system to send the message. Your friend can then reply, but until you actually read 
			their response, it hasn't been received by you. You need one more line of code to get the response so you can work with it. That line of code 
			uses the <kbd>receive</kbd> and <kbd>end</kbd> keywords, put's the 6 in the variable <kbd>Resp</kbd> and looks like this.
		</p>
		<p>
		<pre>
		<code class="Erlang">recieve Resp -> Resp end.
</code></pre></p>
		<p>
			This line of code says,"Wait until you recieve a message. When you get a message, put it in Resp. Then stop waiting."
		</p>
		<p>
			So there you've seen the basics of starting a process, sending it messages, and getting response messages. A little later in this reading you'll see 
			how to automate this to make it even easier, but right now it's a good idea to see how to write the code for a process. We'll use the <kbd>simp_calc</kbd> 
			process since you're already a little familiar with it. This example covers the basics.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, then what does creating, starting, and using a process look like in Erlang? Well, just like your friends, an Erlang process needs to have some 
			way to recieve a message, make sure it understands the message, and then send a response. Also, just like your friends, the process shouldn't die 
			after it helps you out. &#128519; Let's start by looking at the code for an erlang process that performs simple tasks that won't distract from 
			learning process structure and use. Let's create a rediculously simple calculator process called <kbd>simp_calc</kbd> by putting functions in a 
			<kbd>simp_calc</kbd> module, including documentation.
		</p>
		<p>
		<pre>
		<code class="Erlang">-module(simp_calc).
-export([loop/0]).

%% @doc The &lt;kbd&gt;loop/0&lt;/kbd&gt; function is the service keep-alive function. 
%% &lt;kbd&gt;loop/0&lt;/kbd&gt; offers several services;
%% &lt;ol&gt;
%%   &lt;li&gt;multiplication of all elements of a list of numbers (BigO(n)),&lt;/li&gt;
%%   &lt;li&gt;addition of all elements of a list of numbers (BigO(n)),and&lt;/li&gt;
%%   &lt;li&gt;division of two numbers, the dividend followed by the divisor in a tuple.
%% &lt;/ol&gt;
%% All messages are to be tuples following the pattern {\&lt;pid\&gt;,\&lt;command\&gt;,
%% \&lt;list\&gt;} for
%% those acting on lists, and {\&lt;pid\&gt;,\&lt;command\&gt;,\&lt;tuple\&gt;} for those that 
%% act on more than one item, but not a list of them.

%% Available message types are, &lt;kbd&gt;multiply&lt;/kbd&gt;, &lt;kbd&gt;add&lt;/kbd&gt;, and 
%% &lt;kbd&gt;divide&lt;/kbd&gt;.
loop()-&gt;
    receive
        {Pid,{multiply,List}} ->
              Pid ! {ok,lists:foldl(fun(X,Y)->X*Y end,1,List)};
        {Pid,{add,List}} ->
              Pid ! {ok,lists:foldl(fun(X,Y)->X+Y end,0,List)};
        {Pid,{divide,Dividend,Divisor}} -> 
              Pid ! {ok,Dividend div Divisor}
    end,
    loop().
</code></pre></p>

	<p>
		Take a look at the <kbd>loop/0</kbd> function. You'll find it right after its documentation. Notice that it also uses the <kbd>receive</kbd> and 
		<kbd>end</kbd> keywords. Also notice that it isn't actually a loop. It is a tail-recursive function. Also, remember the <kbd>receive</kbd> keyword causes 
		the process to pause until a message is received. Between the <kbd>recieve</kbd> and <kbd>end</kbd> keywords you'll see several options for the incoming 
		message. When a match is found the code in the <kbd>-></kbd> block is executed. The code executed in each of these blocks are examples of things learned 
		in previous weeks. If you don't recognize them, go back and review. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In its current form, if no match is made no response message is sent, so any waiting receive will hang. We'll learn how to deal with this later.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that <kbd>Pid</kbd> is the process ID of the process to which the response message is to be sent and the <kbd>!</kbd> operator is also used here to send a message. 
		Nothing new to learn on this end to send a message back! &#129395;&#128526;
	</p>

	<p>
		So let's solve that problem of not finding a match. Below is an updated code snippet that shows the code that solves this problem for us.
	</p>
	<p><pre><code class="Erlang">loop()-&gt;
    receive
        {Pid,{multiply,List}} ->
              Pid ! {ok,lists:foldl(fun(X,Y)->X*Y end,1,List)};
        {Pid,{add,List}} ->
              Pid ! {ok,lists:foldl(fun(X,Y)->X+Y end,0,List)};
        {Pid,{divide,Dividend,Divisor}} -> 
              Pid ! {ok,Dividend div Divisor};
        {Pid,_Other} ->
              Pid ! {fail, unrecognized_message}
    end,
    loop().
</code></pre></p>
	<p>
		You may be thinking, "But what if they don't send a process ID to respond too?" Good question. Don't put in an error handling match for that. Let them 
		be responsible for their own actions. &#128519; Besides, you couldn't tell them they did it wrong anyway. They will get a message that says something 
		like this.
	</p>
	<p><pre><code class="Erlang">{badarg,[{simp_calc,loop,0,[{file,"simp_calc.erl"},{line,33}]}]}
</code></pre></p>
	<p>
		If you get a message that looks like that when you send a message to a process, you know you didn't put the message together well.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is two more things you should understand about the code for the process you saw earlier. There is nothing special about the <kbd>loop/0</kbd> function. It's just a function. You could name it anything you want, <kbd>again</kbd>, <kbd>wait</kbd>, or even something as silly as <kbd>skip_down_the_road</kbd>. 
		The name the function is unimportant. Also, the function can have any number of parameters you want. Say there was something you wanted the process to 
		'remember' between times when it receives a request. All you have to do is add a parameter. If, for some reason, you needed to track how many times the 
		process received a request and print out that count when the server is shut down, the code could look like. 
	</p>
	<p><pre><code class="Erlang">loop(Count)-&gt;
    receive
        {Pid,{multiply,List}} ->
              Pid ! {ok,lists:foldl(fun(X,Y)->X*Y end,1,List)};
        {Pid,{add,List}} ->
              Pid ! {ok,lists:foldl(fun(X,Y)->X+Y end,0,List)};
        {Pid,{divide,Dividend,Divisor}} -> 
              Pid ! {ok,Dividend div Divisor};
        {Pid,_Other} ->
              Pid ! {fail, unrecognized_message}
    end,
    loop(Count+1).
</code></pre></p>
	<p>
		Since loop is just like any other recursive function, the number of parameters is up to you as are the types of those parameters. If you needed to, you could 
		have paramters of type atom, tuple, list, numeric, or any other type. The set of parameters you use are usually referred to as the "state" of the process.
	</p>
	<p>Having seen how to write a simple process that 
		can receive and send messages, it's now time to make it easier to send a message to a process. You are getting tired of re-typing message sending code 
		in the REPL, right? &#128578;
	</p>
	<h3>Sending Messages Made Easy</h3>
	<p>
		Wouldn't it be great to write a function that could send a message to a process, wait for the response, and then give us the response? Let's do that! It's 
		going to look alot like the <kbd>loop/0</kbd> function internally, thank heavens! Here is a code snippet for just such a function.
	</p>
<p><pre><code class="Erlang">calculate(Pid,Command_and_data,Response_handler)->
     Pid ! {self(),Command_and_data},
     receive
         Response ->
             Completion_handler(Response)
     end.
</code></pre></p>
<p>
	As mentioned, it sends the message, waits for the response, and then uses the <kbd>fun</kbd> passed in as a parameter, <kbd>Response_handler</kbd>, to deal 
	with the data after it shows up. Here again, a <kbd>fun</kbd> is passed in so there is no hard-coding needed in the function to deal with it. That's 
	a GOOD thing.
</p>

Here is a code snippet showing the use of <kbd>calculate</kbd> in the REPL. I put it in a module called <kbd>calc_it</kbd>.
<p><pre><code class="Erlang">Pid = spawn(simp_calc,loop,[]).
calc_it:calculate(Pid,{add, [1,2,3,4,5]},fun(R) -> io:format("Response: ~p~n",[R]) end).
</code></pre></p>
<p>
	Notice that in the <kbd>fun</kbd> passed in, all I'm doing is printing out the result. I just wanted to keep the example simple. You could do a lot more 
	fun things.
</p>
<h2>Client-Server</h2>
<p>
	So, unbeknownst to you, the two modules you just saw fall into a class of computing called <kbd>client-server</kbd>. The process in the <kbd>simple_calc</kbd> 
	module is a server, and the code in the <kbd>calc_it</kbd> module is a client for that server. It is important to know that a server is a piece of software. 
	Sometimes we use the term to refer to the hardware, virtual or not, that the server runs on, but the reason we do that is because of the SOFTWARE!
</p>

<h2>Wrap Up</h2>
<p>
	Now that you have seen how to do basic client-server processes, you are ready, next week, to learn how to do client-server using a bunch of BIF's and 
	patterns to make your life easier. These are part of the OTP portion of the Erlang language. 
</p>

<h2>Appendix: A Template</h2>
<p>
	Here is a template suggested by Joe Armstrong, one of the creators of Erlang, as being a good place to start when you are creating processes. The 
	code comes from </p>
<iframe type="text/html" width="336" height="550" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=B00I9GR4TW&preview=inline&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_5qzTFbKCFS400" ></iframe>
<p>
	The code has the client and server code in one module, but doesn't use a <kbd>fun</kbd> as a response handler for the client function. 
	You could add that. &#128521; The function name <kbd>rpc</kbd> is short hand for 'remote procedure call.' A term you will hear in computing a lot.
</p>
<p><pre><code class="Erlang">-module(ctemplate).
-export([start/0,rpc/2]).
start() ->
	spawn(?module,loop,[]).%this is a very effective way of not having to type this over and over in your code.

rpc(Pid, Request) -> %no response handler parameter. You probably want one
	Pid ! {self(),Request}
	recieve
		{Pid,Response} ->
			Response %ignoring the response
	end.

loop()->
	receive
		Any ->
			io:format("Received:~p~n",[Any]),%empty looping. does not send a response.
			loop()
	end.
