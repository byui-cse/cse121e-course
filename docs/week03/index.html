      <h1>Organization and Access</h1>
      <p>
        All computer languages are ways to organize your communication and
        thinking. In this, they are very similar to spoken languages. Each
        spoken language, or family of spoken languages, does this organization
        differently. English sentences often have a structure of Subject-Helper
        Verb-Verb-Predicate...The boy will bite the dog, for example. German, a
        language closely related to English, organizes things differently.
        Sometimes German sentences have a Subject-Helper Verb-Predicate-Verb
        structure... Ich werde das Buch bald lesen, which if translated
        word-by-word is "I will the book soon read." Spanish has adjectives
        after the nouns they modify.
      </p>
      <p>
        While each language has its own organizational rules, these rules all do the
        same thing. They allow us to organize and express our thinking.
      </p>
      <h3>Functions - a fundamental organization concept of Erlang</h3>
      <p>
        Python and Erlang, being related languages, both have functions as a
        fundimental organizational structure. In Erlang this organization is so 
        strong a principle that you can't put code in a file unless it is 
        a function or in a function.
        </p>
        <p>When you truly begin thinking in
        Erlang, you will be thinking in functions. You will think of how
        functions are related to each other. You will have thoughts along these
        lines, "If this function calls that one..." You will be able to do this
        since you will eventually realize that when you are designing solutions
        in Erlang, how a function accomplishes something is not as important
        as that it will, and that you can wait to figure out how to complete the
        function later.
      </p>

      <h3>Modules - organizing functions in Erlang</h3>
      <p>
        Like Python, Erlang uses modules as a way to organize your functions. 
        Unlike Python, Erlang allows you to make it possible to make some 
        of your functions unavailable to programmers who are not working in 
        the module itself. This allows you to have 'helper functions' to 
        do the heavy lifting and functions that are easier to call that 
        others can use. When you get to 'thinking in functions,' you 
        won't care how a function you call accomplishes its task, just that it 
        does. The reality is that, in Erlang, you must explicitly tell a module 
        which functions other programmers are allowed to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is an example module. This module is found in a source code file named <kbd>funcs.erl</kbd>. 
        Erlang, like Python, requires the module name to be the name of the file in which it resides.

      <pre>
<code class="Erlang">-module(funcs).
  2 -export([print_parts/1,factorial/1,double/1]).
</code></pre>
      The first line is a function call that declares the atom that is the name of the module, <kbd>funcs</kbd>. 
      The second line is a function call, <kbd>-export</kbd>, that is passed a list of functions that are made available 
      for use outside of the <kbd>funcs</kbd> module. Each entry in the export list consists of two parts, 
      1)the atom that is the name of the function to export, and 2) the number of parameters that function has. 
      These two parts are always seperated by the <kbd>/</kbd> character. Just so you understand, the use of 
      <kbd>/</kbd> here does NOT indicate division.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the code snippet above, a module called <kbd>funcs</kbd> is declared. Three functions, <kbd>print_parts</kbd>, 
        <kbd>factorial</kbd>, and <kbd>double</kbd> are made available for use outside the module. This is the module's 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Using Functions</h3>
      <p>
        In Python and Erlang there are similarities and differences between
        the languages regarding how you declare functions. Unlike Python's use of <kbd>def</kbd>, 
        Erlang requires no keyword to identify a function. Also, Erlang 
        uses either snake_case or camelCase for function names. In this class, we'll use 
        snake_case. For example, a function that averages two numbers could be defined like this.
      </p>
      <pre>
<code class="Erlang">average_two_numbers(First, Second) -> (First + Second) div 2.
</code>
	</pre>
      <p>
        Lets break down the syntax into English. "There is a function named <kbd>average_two_numbers</kbd>. It has 
        two parameters, <kbd>First</kbd> and <kbd>Second</kbd>. The body of the function sums the <kbd>First</kbd> 
        and <kbd>Second</kbd> variables, and then the sum is divided by <kbd>2</kbd> using integer division."
      </p>
      <p>
        It is very important to notice that EVERY function ends with a '.' just like every English sentence. Also, the 
        <kbd>-></kbd> operator indicates the code to execute, the 'body' of the function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Single line functions are nice, but not everything should be done using single line functions. As a simple example, 
        here is some code to print out the head and the tail of a list on seperate lines in the REPL. Yes, there are 
        better ways to perform this behavior. That isn't the point of this code snippet. The point is to see what 
        multi-line functions look like syntax-wise.
      </p>

      <pre>
<code class="Erlang">print_parts([H|T]) ->
  io:format("Head: ~p~n",[H]),
  io:format("Tail: ~p~n",[T]).
</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    Just as before, the code to be executed bounded by the <kbd>-></kbd> and <kbd>.</kbd> operators. All of the other lines 
    end with the <kbd>,</kbd> operator. This is, once again, similar to <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/punctuation/commas/extended_rules_for_commas.html">English punctuation rules</a>. In English, all sentances 
    end with a period, and any independent clauses in the sentance that are joined by a coordinating conjunction (and, but, or, etc.) end in a comma. 
    Here is a simple English sentence that illustrates this punctuation rule. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The dog barked, and the wolf howled.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice that this could have been written as, "The dog barked. The wolf howled." The two clauses are independent since they are gramatically 
    correct when written seperately. The Erlang example, above, follows this English punctuation rule. The body of the function has two independent 
    functions. They are combined together using the <kbd>,</kbd> operator and an implied <kbd>and</kbd>. "Print the head, and print the tail." 
    The concept and punctuation/grammar rules of combining dependent clauses in some spoken languages drove the selection of this syntactical choice
    for Erlang. Why reinvent the wheel?
  </p>
  <p>
    Be warned and forewarned! The above function as written has a major problem. The problem is this, what if the list is empty? How then can the head be 
    split from the tail? It can't. If you put the above function in a module file, compile the module, and then call the function using an empty list, 
    you will get this error message.
  </p>
  <P><kbd>** exception error: no function clause matching funcs:print_parts([])</kbd></P>
  <p>
    This error is mysterious until greater knowledge and understanding is gained. There is something missing from the function as it was declared. But 
    don't worry, the fix is easy and applies a variation of the Erlang pattern matching concept from week 02's reading. Here is the code snippet in 
    it's fixed form.
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre>
<code class="Erlang">print_parts([])->
  io:format("Empty List");
print_parts([H|T]) ->
  io:format("Head: ~p~n",[H]),
  io:format("Tail: ~p~n",[T]).
</code>
  </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    At first it may seem that the fix creates two functions but it does not. Notice that the end of the body for the fist use of <kbd>print_parts</kbd> 
    does NOT end in a period. That's why the first use of <kbd>print_parts</kbd> can NOT be a function all by itself. Instead of a period, the body of 
    the first use of <kbd>print_parts</kbd> ends in a semicolon. 
    The <kbd>print_parts</kbd> function starts with the first use of <kbd>print_parts</kbd> and ends with a period. The <kbd>print_parts</kbd> function 
    consists of two dependent clauses seperated by a semicolon. Once again, 
    Erlang is following <a href="https://www.econtentpro.com/blog/when-to-use-a-semicolon/7">the grammar/punctuation rules for depented clauses 
    of some spoken languages</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the <kbd>print_parts</kbd> function is called, Erlang uses pattern matching to decide which clause of the function will execute. That's why, 
    in the code above, if the <kbd>print_parts</kbd> function is called and passed an empty list, the first clause is used and executed. If <kbd>print_parts</kbd> 
    is called and passed a non-empty list, the second clause of <kbd>print_parts</kbd> matches the use of the function and the second clause is used 
    and executed. Now the error message you saw before the fix was made, 
  </p>
  <p><kbd>** exception error: no function clause matching funcs:print_parts([])</kbd></p>
  <p>
    starts to make sense. It says, "Error: I tried to find a clause for the <kbd>print_parts</kbd> function that matches the pattern 
    <kbd>funcs:print_parts([])</kbd> but couldn't. Did you forget to add one or did you use the wrong parameters?"
  </p>
  <p>
    When you are adding clauses to a function, it is important that you order the independent clauses you are adding. No matter how many 
    independent clauses there are in your function, order them from most to least restrictive. Otherwise you will get 
    unexpected behavior when you use the function. You will see an example of this soon.
  </p>
  <h3>Why This Design for Functions?</h3>
  <p>
    By having function independent clauses and using pattern matching to determine which of those clauses is used makes it possible to 'think in functions' as was 
    mentioned at the top of this page. In other languages that don't take this approach to functions, you usually have to have some sort of 'if' behavior inside 
    the function to do the pattern matching by hand. Because of the way Erlang uses pattern matching, no such conditional branching is needed, and the programmer 
    using the function has to know LESS about how the function works internally than they would in some other languages. 
  </p>
  <p>
    While this distinction may not seem a big deal to you right now, when you start creating more complicated reality-like applications with millions of lines of 
    code, this distinction becomes very important. Think of how many 'if' type lines of code you don't have to create in Erlang compared to other languages if 
    your application consists of hundreds of thousands of functions. Also remember that any new code you write, including these 'if' type lines of code, are 
    green-code. In other words, they will have bugs in them. So, with Erlang, you write less code which leads, always, to fewer bugs created.
   </p>
   <p>
     There is another benefit, amoung many others that you will see, of this clause/pattern matching approach to functions. Take a look at how the factorial behavior 
     from mathematics can be written using two clauses, one when the function is passed <kbd>0</kbd>, and the other when it is passed a non-zero value.
   </p>
  <p>
    <pre>
<code class="Erlang">factorial(0) -> 1;
factorial(N) -> N * factorial(N-1).
</code>
  </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice how there are no 'if' type constructs in the code just like is described above. Also notice that this is a recursive function! Because of 
    Erlang's clause/pattern matching approach to functions, you don't EVER need loops. In fact, there are no loop constructs in Erlang. You just don't 
    need them.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are some <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/efficiency_guide/myths.html">false beliefs about Erlang</a> running around the internet. One of them is that you should always use tail-recursion in Erlang. Not so. First of all, tail-recursion isn't faster. Another is that if you don't use tail-recursion, you'll end up 
    having a stack overflow happen at runtime. Not so. Erlang is desgned so that you will run out of RAM instead of getting a stack overflow. These statements 
    don't mean you can ignore tail-recursion, it just means you don't have to go through contortions to make all your functions tail-recursive. I like 
    <a href="https://ferd.ca/erlang-s-tail-recursion-is-not-a-silver-bullet.html">this statement by Fred Herbert</a> .

    "Writing clean code generally leads to better performance. This is something that many languages can not claim as true, but Erlang certainly can. In the general case, the optimisations in the Erlang VM come from observing idiomatic code in production, and clean [code] at that. This is why body recursion might be better, and why many other optimizations were made...Clean code is the best code."
  </p>
  <p>
    The point he is making is that sometimes, in Erlang, body-recursive functions, those that are non-tail-recusive, can sometimes be better.
  </p>
  <p class="callout">
    <span>Interesting Info:</span><br>
        Another great result of Erlang's being a functional programming language and functional programming languages' affinity with Mathematics is the 
        similarity between the Erlang version of multi-part functions and how you describe them in Mathematics. Take a look and compare the erlang version 
        with this Mathematics version of factorial.
        
      <img src="images/fact.png" alt="the bipartite representation of the factorial function">
      Such a close match! Again, why reinvent the wheel? The Erlang creators tried very hard to not add unnecessary stuff you'd have to know in addition 
      to things you already know.
  </p>
  <h2>Guards, Guards!</h2>
  <p>
    In the factorial example, above, it was very important to get the order of the function's clauses correct so that the function would execute as expected. 
    This can be problematic when you have functions containing many clauses or when the pattern matching isn't as simple as factorial. Erlang's solution 
    to these problems is called a guard. The keyword for a guard is <kbd>when</kbd>. Here is a code snippet example of a factorial function that 
    not only uses guards, but adds another clause so if factorial is called with a negative number, a situation which is undefined in Mathematics, the function 
    retuns an atom representing a failure.
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre>
<code class="Erlang">factorial(N) when N > 0 -> N * factorial(N-1);
factorial(N) when N == 0 -> 1;
factorial(N) when N < 0 -> undefined.%Factorials of negative integers are not defined. Therefore return the atom undefined.
</code>
  </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    By using guards, the order of our independent clauses is irrelevant, freeing us from a potential ordering bugs. It does cost us in a little more code, 
    but in most cases, the extra text is worth it, especially when your guards need to be more complicated than this simplistic example.
  </p>

  <h2>Recursion and Lists</h2>
  <p>
    There are better ways to do this upcoming example that you'll see in a bit, but let's take a look at how to build a new list that is the numbers in a list multiplied by <kbd>2</kbd>. In the code snippet below you see a function called <kbd>double</kbd>. Notice that in this case we don't need to worry about the order of the clauses 
    since there is no way for the pattern matcher to fail. That is also why no guards are needed. Eiter a list has elements and matches the first clause, or 
    the list is empty and matches the last clause. Those are the only two options.
  </p>
  <p>
<pre>
<code class="Erlang">double([H|T]) ->
    [2 * H | double(T)];
double([]) ->
    [].</code></pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Also notice the use of the cons operator, <kbd>[H|T]</kbd>, to split the list passed to the function into the head of the list and the tail, the rest of the 
    numbers in the list. The Head is then multiplied by <kbd>2</kbd> and the cons operator is used to prepend the result to whatever is returned from calling 
    the <kbd>double</kbd> function on the remaining tail numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    This way, each time <kbd>double</kbd> gets called, the list it is passed gets smaller by one number until the list is empty. Then, after getting to the end of 
    the list, each doubled number is prepended to a new list, last number first, until the doubled values are all included, first number last <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29?lang=eng">(Doctrine and 
    Covenants 29:30)</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Put the <kbd>double</kbd> function, above, in a file as part of a module, compile the module in the REPL, and run it. Then play around with it. What happens if you 
    print out the values of <kbd>H</kbd> and <kbd>T</kbd>? Try out a few other changes you dream up. This exploration process should help you understand the 
    list disassembly-reassembly precess that is a major part of writing Erlang code.
