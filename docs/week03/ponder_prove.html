    <h1>CSE 121e: Week 03</h1>
    <p>Ponder and Prove</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>You own an ice cream shop, The Double Dip, that only offers two-scoop
		cones. Based on previous data collected regarding your customers, to reduce waste and increase
		profitability, you have two lists customers can select from.</p>
	<p> List one is:
	<ul>
		<li>Vanilla,</li>
		<li>Chocolate, and</li>
		<li>Cherry Ripple.</li>
	</ul>
	List two is:
	<ul>
		<li>Lemon,</li>
		<li>Butterscotch, and</li>
		<li>Licorice Ripple.</li>
	</ul> </p>
	<p>Data collected by your staff indicates that Chocolate is your
	customers&rsquo; preferred flavor from list one. To aid you in deciding how to plan
	your ice cream purchases in future weeks, you need to know what all the
	possible combinations of flavors given that customers can select one flavor from list one and one flavor from list two. </p>

	<h1>Your Task</h1>
	<p>
		Depending on how you design your task solutions, you may need some <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/lists.html#foldl-3">list BIF's</a> not covered in the reading.
	</p>
	<ol>
		  <li><p>
          Write a function that
		prints all possible combinations of flavors
		for your two-scoop cones as a list of lists where one of the flavors in all
		the sub-lists is Chocolate.</p></li>
		  <li><p>
          AFTER completing the code for (1) and examining the generated list,
			you realize your customers might want to combine any flavor in a list with
			any flavor in either list. In fact they might want a Chocolate-Chocolate
			cone. That means you will have to change your menu to have a single list
			with instructions for the customer to &ldquo;select a flavor for each
			scoop&rdquo;.</p>

			    <p>Print out all
       			double-dipper cones that have Chocolate as the first or second scoop type, including chocolate-chocolate.
       		</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      	<p>
      		You decide you also need a list of all possible combinations of flavors in addition to those that have chocolate as the first flavor. Print out all possible scoop combinations.
      	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      	<p>
      		You decide to gather data about the popularity of all of these combinations. After having done so, you decide to print out a sorted list of all the combinations with those that are the most popular first. Use the <a href="">rand:uniform/0</a> BIF to simulate this collected data. You can use any scale you would like for the popularity data.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		Print out the entire list.
      	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      	<p>
      		You become curious regarding how popular the top 10 combinations are. Print out the top ten most popular combinations, each with its popularity. Also calculate and print the percentage popularity of of these 10 compared to all the combinations.
      	</p>
      </li>
	</ol>

		<h2>Optional Challenge</h2>
		<p>
			Copy your code from last week's task solution. Modify it so it generates all possible combinations of teams and selects the four team combinations with the highest propensity for success.

      <h3>Review</h3>
      <h4>After completing the previous steps:</h4>
      <ol>
          <li>Review one of the many <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse121e-course/week03/provided_solution.zip">possible solutions</a> for this task,</li>
          <li>Compare and contrast your code with the possible solutions&rsquo; code, and</li>
          <li>Make note of any improvements you could make for future tasks.</li>
      </ol>
