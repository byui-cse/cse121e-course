	<h2>The Why of Erlang</h2>
	<h3>Some Background</h3>
	<p>
		The Ericsson corporation in northern Europe had a need. Their old telephone control system was going to be replaced with 
	new hardware. They had created the new hardware, but the design and development of the controlling software collapsed. They needed to replace that 
	development with something else, or loose a lot of money. Thankfully they had been financing Joe Armstrong and others to explore “a better way of programming telephony applications” as part of Ericsson's research lab expenditures since the late 1980's. 
	</p>

	<p>
		In the lab, Armstrong and a few others had been creating and experimenting with a new language they called <a href="https://www.erlang.org">Erlang</a>. Initially concieved as an internal Ericson language, those responsible, including Armstrong, found that the language worked very well for any system that needed massively concurrent, distributed applications with nearly 100% uptimes. In 1998, the Ericsson corporation open sourced Erlang. Since then, many companies including Google, Amazon, WhatsApp, Digital Ocean, MasterCard, Nintendo, and many others have adopted Erlang as a major part of their design and development core set of tools. 
	</p>
	<p>If you want more information on the history of Erlang, Joe Armstrong wrote an <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1238844.1238850">article for the ACM</a> outlining how and why Erlang became what it is.</p>
	<h3>Python and Erlang are Cousins</h3>
	<p>Take a look at Figure 1. It shows the ancestery of both <a href="https://www.erlang.org">Erlang</a> and Python. Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula"  target="_blank">Modula</a> is an ancestor of both languages
       	you can expect to see some
	things in Erlang that remind you of what you learned about coding when you studied Python. An example of this is the concept of a module.

<h2>Installations</h2>
	<p>
		Before doing anything else, you will need to <a href="<a href="https://www.erlang.org"> download and install the Erlang compiler and tools for your OS.</a>
	</p>
	<h3>The IDE</h3>
	<p>The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) selected for this course is 
	<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>. Go to the 
	<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">site for Visual Studio Code</a> download the installer for your
	operating system. When you start the download you will be taken to a page that will help you get started. Since you will 
	be writting in Erlang, <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pgourlain.erlang" target="_blank">the VSCode plugin</a>. Ignore all of the hints, steps, and photos on the page. Those are for using a tool called rebar3 which we won't be using in this introductory class.
	</p>
	<p>It's OK if you don't understand everything about VSCode and this plugin right off the bat. You'll 
	gradually learn as you run into a need. This plugin will enable color coding for Erlang in VSCode and pull up help docs for built-in Erlang functions (BIFs) when you move your mouse over a function and type Command (MacOS) or control (Windows).</p>
	

<h2>Test Your Tools</h2>
	<p>Download and unzip this <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse121b-course/week01/example_source/stepwise_debugging.zip">directory</a> that contains two files you can use to test VSCode and Chrome applications you installed on your machine. After going to where you 
	downloaded the file, select it and unzip it.</p>
	<h3>How to Unzip</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14200/windows-compress-uncompress-zip-files" target="_blank">Windows</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-zip-and-unzip-files-and-folders-on-a-mac-2260188" target="_blank">MacOS</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.hostingmanual.net/zipping-unzipping-files-unix/" target="_blank">Linux</a></li>
	</ul>	
	<h3>Testing Your Browser</h3>
	<p>After the folder is unzipped, right or control click the index.html file in the first_load_js directory and select
	'Open with' and Chrome. You will see this in the browser.</p>
	<img src="images/first_js_load.png" class="steps_image" alt="instructions for accessing the developer tools"/>
	<p>Follow the directions on the screen. You should now see this.</p>
	<img src="images/first_js_see.png" class="steps_image" alt="a view of the developer tools"/>
	<p>What you see on the right-hand side are called the developer tools. The tool we are most interested in, for now, is
	the console. Click the word 'Console' at the top of the developer tools and you should see this which includes the 
	current date and time.<p>
	<img src="images/first_js_console.png" class="steps_image" alt="a view of the console"/>
	<p>When you reach this point, you know your browser is setup correctly and you now know how you will use the browser's
	console to see the results of computing using Erlang.</p>
	<h3>Testing Your IDE</h3>
	<p>Run Visual Studio Code. If this is the first time you've run it you should see this.
	</p>
	<img src="images/first_js_vsc_startup.png" class="steps_image" alt="initial view of visual studio code"/>
	<p>Now it is time to open the files in the first_load_js directory in VS Code. To do this select File->Open from the 
	VS Code pull down menues. You will now need to navigate to where you stored the first_load_js directory on your 
	computer's harddrive. Then select first_load_js and click the Open button in the Open dialog box. You should now 
	see this.</p>
	<img src="images/first_js_vsc_open_folder.png" class="steps_image" alt="view of visual studio code after directory loaded"/>
	<p>To see your code, first click FIRST_LOAD_JS and then click learning.js. You should now see the Erlang that 
	was run to write the date and time to your browsers console. It should look like this.</p>
	<img src="images/first_js_vsc_show_code.png" class="steps_image" alt="showing Erlang in VS Code"/>


<h2>Workflow</h2>
	<p>The work you do using these two tools will flow like this. Each time you are asked to do an assignment, you will create a directory named for the assignment. For example, if you were asked for your assignment to write code that calculated loan payments, you could create a folder called loan_pay_calc. Then, using your operating system,
       	you would copy index.html and learn.js from first_load_js into the loan_pay_calc directory. Finally, you would open the loan_pay_calc folder in VS Code, open the learn.js file, and replace the Erlang code in learn.js with 
	code that would calculate loan payments.</p>
	<p>If you follow this pattern for each assignment, you will reduce your workload.</p>
