        Since you will be using output to the erl REPL as a major way to debug your Erlang code in this class, It's a good idea to be able to retrieve data from and diplay data to the REPL. Since you have litte to no experience with Erlang, there is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50109119/how-to-accept-input-from-user-console-in-erlang" alt="a page that has some code to use as an example">a web page</a> that you can use as an example for for the code you're writing. Don't bother reading the question asked, just look at the answer given. That's where the example code is. You will also want to take a look at an <a href="https://www.ascii-code.com" alt="a table that relates characters to numbers">ascii table that shows you that characters are actually numbers in computing systems</a>.
      </p>

        <p>To this end, create a folder using your OS called task01. Load this folder in VSCode and in it, create a file called <kbd>io_explore.erl</kbd>. In the file,
        <ol>
          <li>declare a module called io_explore (file names and module names must match in Erlang),</li>
          <li>export two functions (in one export statement). Call the functions 
            <ul>
              <li><kbd>print_greeting_nice</kbd> (with no parameters and asks the user for their name) and</li>
              <li><kbd>print_greeting_strange</kbd> (with no parameters and asks the user for their name)</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>write the <kbd>print_greeting_nice</kbd> function using the format string <kbd>"It is so nice to meet you ~s.~n"</kbd> as the first parameter to the <kbd>io:format</kbd> function,</li>
            <li>load, compile, and debug the module,</li>
            <li>write the <kbd>print_greeting_strange</kbd> function using the format string <kbd>"It is so nice to meet you ~w.~n"</kbd> as the first parameter to the <kbd>io:format</kbd> function, and</li>
            <li>load, compile, and debug the module with these new changes.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many things you haven't learned yet regarding this code you'll write. You'll learn about them later in the class. Don't be overly concerned about not understanding everything right now. Do, however, consider what was printed out by <kbd>print_greeting_strange</kbd> taking into account what you see in the <a href="https://www.ascii-code.com" alt="a table that relates characters to numbers">asci table</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When calling the functions in the erl REPL, remember to put quotation marks around the name you type in and to end the line with a period. If you don't do these two things, you will get some errors you aren't ready to tackle yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        AFTER you have completed and debugged your code, <a href="<img src="provided_solution/io_explore.erl" class="steps_image" alt="one of many possible code solutions">take a look at one of many possible solutions</a> and compare it to the code you wrote.
