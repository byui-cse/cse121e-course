    <h1>CSE 121e: Week 02</h1>
    <p>Ponder and Prove</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
		You work for a TV production company. The Show is a program that has, as a major design component, competition between teams and cooperation within teams. 
	</p>
	<h1>Your Task</h1>
	<p>
		Your boss needs help selecting good teams from persons that have been selected to be potential participants. He has assigned you to help with this effort.
	</p>
		
	<ol>
	  <li>
	  	<p>
	  		Being new to Erlang, you decide to start by doing some experimentation so you can see what to expect from Erlang lists and expressions. You have written some unit tests in the <kbd>build_teams.erl</kbd> file in the <a href="game_show.zip">game_show.zip</a> file you got from your team. You figured these would help you see what happens in various situations. Write code to complete the functions and tests in the <kbd>build_teams.erl</kbd> file. <a href="./game_show.zip">Download the project you created</a>, unzip it, and finish the needed lines of code.
			</p>
			<p>
				You found a <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/assert.hrl.html" target="_blank">web page</a> with list of all of the possible assertions available.
			</p>
	  </li>
	</ol>
	<h1>Stretch Challenge (Optional)</h1>
	<p>
				Put the following in the REPL.
	</p>
	<kbd>1234567890123456789.0 - 1234567890123456788.0.</kbd>
	<p>
		The result is not <kbd>1.0</kbd>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Put the following in the REPL.
	</p>
	<kbd>1234567890123456789123456789.0 - 123456789012345678912356788.0.</kbd>
	<p>
		The result is not <kbd>1.0</kbd>. See if you can figure out why this is so for both differences.
	</p>
	<p>
		Suggestion: Take a look at <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/cs/floating-point-numbers-inaccuracy" target="_blank">Why are floating point numbers inaccurate?</a>
