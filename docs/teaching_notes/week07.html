        <h2>Week 07 Goals</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Students will be able to write, as an aid to solidifying their own thinking, two or three paragraphs regarding what characteristics good online sources of information regarding Erlang have in common versus poor sources for Erlang.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This week is typically very short. Students have a simple task to complete. In your announcement, you could encourage students to ponder on the different sources of information they've encountered as they've been learning about Erlang and to compile a list of resources they can use for future Erlang projects.</p>

        <h2>Before the Week Begins</h2>
        <h3>Inspire Your Students</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Share an insight from a scripture or a general conference talk.
                <ul>
                    <li>You can be a great role model for students about what it means to study the gospel and apply it to your own life. During this lesson, consider making a video or sending a class-wide email highlighting an insight from a general conference talk or the scriptures and how it applies to your life.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Consider sharing a gospel insight on how you have applied gospel principles in your career.</li>
            <li>Consider sharing an example of how you used concepts from this week in your own profession. Perhaps the experience can be related to a programming challenge you or a team had to resolve.</li>
        </ul>



        <h2>During the Week</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitor the Microsoft Teams channels. Interacting with students is where much of your time should be spent. You may consider reaching out to those students who appear not to be regularly participating.</li>
        </ul>
       
        <h3>Grading and Feedback</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Check the results from the W06 Quiz with the Tasks to determine if any students who completed the quiz did not turn in a task submission. If students do not submit their tasks but receive points from the quiz, you should reach out to them to ask for the submission so you can check their understanding. You are allowed to remove their quiz points if they do not respond to you or refuse to submit the task for review and feedback.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>Post the final grades.</p>
