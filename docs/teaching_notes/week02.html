        <h2>Week 02 Goals</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Introduce Erlang syntax for basic concepts such as operators and variables.</li>
            <li>Introduce the new-to-the-students concept of immutability.</li>
            <li>Introduce the new-to-the-students concepts of atoms and tuples.</li>
            <li>Introduce the students to how Erlang lists work, and why they work this way.</li>
            <li>Introduce the students to the Erlang list BIFs.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Before the Week Begins</h2>
        <h3>Inspire Your Students</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Share an insight from a scripture or a general conference talk.
                <ul>
                    <li>You can be a great role model for students about what it means to study the gospel and apply it to your own life. During this lesson, consider making a video or sending a class-wide email highlighting an insight from a general conference talk or the scriptures and how it applies to your life.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Consider sharing a gospel insight on how you have applied gospel principles in your career.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Discuss what you think are the most difficult part of the reading for students to understand or expound on anything you think would be helpful to the students.</li>
            <li>Consider sharing an example of how you used concepts from this week in your own profession. Perhaps the experience can be related to a programming challenge you or a team had to resolve.</li>
        </ul>



        <h2>During the Week</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitor the Microsoft Teams channels. Interacting with students is where much of your time should be spent. You may consider reaching out to those students who appear not to be regularly participating.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Personalized video</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Create and make available one or more 10 minute videos relative to the goals of this module.
            </li>
            <li>
                On Wednesday, create and upload one or more 10 minute videos covering topics from the week students still are working on understanding, based on your interactions with students on Monday and Tuesday.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reach out to any students in the class that appear to have 'gone dark.'
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Grading and Feedback</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Since there are no graded assignments in this course, you will need to be proactive in reviewing and providing constructive feedback on students' tasks. (See the <a class="inline_disabled" href="general.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Teaching Notes</a>.) Check the results from the W01 Quiz with the Tasks to determine if any students who completed the quiz did not turn in a task submission. If students do not submit their tasks but receive points from the quiz, you should reach out to them to ask for the submission so you can check their understanding. You are allowed to remove their quiz points if they do not respond to you or refuse to submit the task for review and feedback.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Create and post your announcement for W03 by Friday (mountain time) at the end of the week.</li>
            <li>Let students know you will frequently provide feedback on their task submissions. These assignments are not graded; however, students will receive personalized instruction and feedback from you.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Your announcement should include a reference to gospel principles or topics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sample W03 Announcement</h3>
        <div class="txtbox"><b>Week 02 Wrap Up - Release Friday</b><br />
            <p>Dear CSE 121E Students,</p>
            <p>This week we have been learning about basic Erlang syntax, concluding with a task that gave you the opportunity to practice with the Erlang syntax by modifying an existing project. As you finish working on the Week 2 task, if you get stuck, reach out to your team members. If they are not able to help answer your questions, try to search for answers by doing your own Erlang research. You can use Google, but you can also try using ChatGPT. If you use ChatGPT, treat it like a coding buddy or tutor. Instead of asking it to do the work for you, ask it questions that will help you further understand the code you are working on. You'll also notice there is a video walkthrough of a sample solution. Try your best before watching the video, but in the event you are unable to complete the task or get stuck, you can look at the video walkthrough to help you.</p>
            <h3>Week 03 Overview</h3>
            <p>For next week, we'll be learning about how to create functions in Erlang. Functions in Erlang are very different from Python. As you go through the reading material, make sure you try each of the examples. You are encouraged to look for other resources online as you encounter questions. Here are a couple of resources you might find helpful:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="https://erlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://erlang.org/</a> - This site is the official Erlang website, with documentation and examples.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="https://learnyousomeerlang.com/content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://learnyousomeerlang.com</a> - This is a great online book that is free. It contains examples that might help you further understand Erlang. This is an optional resource, but great to use if you would like to see additional examples or read more about specific topics in Erlang.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a reminder, you can create a project using rebar3 by running the following command:</p>
            <p><kbd>rebar3 new lib &lt;name-of-project-here&gt;</kbd></p>
            <p>This command will create the structure for a new project, including a <kbd>src</kbd> folder and an Erlang file to get you started. You can include additional Erlang files in the <kbd>src</kbd> folder and <kbd>rebar3 shell</kbd> will compile all of them. Then you can use the REPL to try running your functions.</p>
