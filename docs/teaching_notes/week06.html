        <h2>Week 06 Goals</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Students will think of a problem they would like to solve using the Erlang language they have learned.</li>
            <li>Students will write the code to solve the problem they have proposed.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This week does not include any new content. Students will spend their time working on a final project of their choosing. Their project should take about 3 hours. Your announcement and discussions with them could include ideas for final projects or invitations to them to reach out to you if they would like to get feedback on their final project ideas. </p>

        <p>Some project ideas include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Revisit an assignment from a previous programming class and complete it in Erlang.</li>
            <li>Create a program that solves an interesting problem or a problem in the student's discipline.</li>
            <li>File I/O: Build an application that can read data from a file, process it, and then write the results to a new file. This could be a log analyzer, a data transformer, or a simple database.</li>
            <li>Explore passing messages between distributed systems: Create a simple system where multiple Erlang nodes can send and receive messages. This could simulate a microservices architecture or a basic chat system between distributed systems.</li>
            <li>A to-do list application: Develop a command-line to-do list application where users can add, view, and delete tasks. The tasks can be persisted in a file or an in-memory data structure.</li>
            <li>A chat application using Erlang processes: Develop a simple chat server where multiple clients can connect and send messages to each other using Erlang's message passing and concurrency features. Focus on creating processes for each client and handling message passing.</li>
            <li>Task Scheduler System: Implement a system that schedules and executes tasks (like sending emails, generating reports, etc.) at specified intervals. This project can leverage Erlang's time-handling and process management capabilities.</li>
            <li>Basic Key-Value Store: Create a simple in-memory key-value store where you can set a value for a key and retrieve it later. This project will help you understand state management in Erlang processes and the concept of message passing.</li>
            <li>File Monitoring System: Build a system that monitors changes in a specific directory (like new files added, files deleted, etc.) and logs these events. This project can utilize Erlang's file handling and process monitoring features.</li>
            <li>Simple Web Server: Develop a basic web server that can handle HTTP requests and serve static content. This will give you exposure to network programming in Erlang and its standard libraries for handling HTTP.</li>
            <li>Data Processing Pipeline: Create a pipeline that processes data (like logs or transaction records) through multiple stages (filter, transform, aggregate) using Erlang processes. This project can demonstrate Erlang's capability in handling parallel data processing tasks.</li>
            <li>Online Voting System: Implement a simple system for online voting, where users can vote for options, and the system tallies the votes. This project can help you understand how to handle user inputs, state management, and concurrency.</li>
            <li>IoT Device Simulator: Simulate an IoT (Internet of Things) environment where multiple devices (like sensors) send data to a central server. This project will allow you to explore Erlang's ability to handle numerous concurrent connections and real-time data processing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Before the Week Begins</h2>
        <h3>Inspire Your Students</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Share an insight from a scripture or a general conference talk.
                <ul>
                    <li>You can be a great role model for students about what it means to study the gospel and apply it to your own life. During this lesson, consider making a video or sending a class-wide email highlighting an insight from a general conference talk or the scriptures and how it applies to your life.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Consider sharing a gospel insight on how you have applied gospel principles in your career.</li>
            <li>Discuss what you think are the most difficult part of the final project or share ideas for an appropriate final project.</li>
            <li>Consider sharing an example of how you used concepts from this week in your own profession. Perhaps the experience can be related to a programming challenge you or a team had to resolve.</li>
        </ul>



        <h2>During the Week</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitor the Microsoft Teams channels. Interacting with students is where much of your time should be spent. You may consider reaching out to those students who appear not to be regularly participating.</li>

            <li>Create and make available one or more 10 minute videos relative to the goals of this module.
            </li>

            <li>
                Reach out to any students in the class that appear to have 'gone dark.'
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Grading and Feedback</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Since there are no graded assignments in this course, you will need to be proactive in reviewing and providing constructive feedback on students' tasks. (See the <a class="inline_disabled" href="general.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Teaching Notes</a>.) Check the results from the W05 Quiz with the Tasks to determine if any students who completed the quiz did not turn in a task submission. If students do not submit their tasks but receive points from the quiz, you should reach out to them to ask for the submission so you can check their understanding. You are allowed to remove their quiz points if they do not respond to you or refuse to submit the task for review and feedback.</li>
            <li>For the final project, the students only need to spend about 3 hours. This means the projects will be relatively simple. Offer encouragement and support to the students. As long as they complete something, even if it is simple, they will be able to claim credit for this assignment.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Create and post your announcement for W07 by Friday (mountain time) at the end of the week.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sample W07 Announcement</h3>
        <div class="txtbox"><b>Week 06 Wrap Up - Release Friday</b><br />
            <p>Hello class,</p>
            <p>As we head into the weekend, please keep in mind that the last day of classes is next week. That means that you will need to complete all tasks, including the Week 07 task, by that date. Refer to the course calendar for specific due dates.</p>
            <p>The Week 07 Task is a bit different from previous assignments. Instead of completing a programming task, you are asked to spend time thinking about the various Erlang information sources you've encountered this semester. Use this time to put together a good reference list for yourself of the best Erlang syntax resources. Evaluate the quality of the sources you've used. Feel free to share some of your favorite sources on the Teams. Consider what makes a resource "good" versus "not so good". See the Task description for more details.</p>
            <p>If you haven't already, remember to finish the Week 06 Task to create an Erlang project of your choosing. I'm looking forward to see what you've created!</p>
            <p>I want to take a moment to thank you all for your participation this block. I've enjoyed interacting with you and getting to know you through your comments and questions. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about the end-of-the-class schedule or your final tasks. I hope you all have a wonderful weekend!</p>
