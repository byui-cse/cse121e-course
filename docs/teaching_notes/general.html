<h2>Course Content</h2>
<p>This course is not a traditional introductory programming course introducing variables, functions, etc. Instead, it is designed to help the students in the course bridge their current knowledge of basic programming principles to the Erlang language. The students in this class have already learned basic programming principles in their previous Python classes, including using lambda functions with <kbd>map</kbd>, <kbd>filter</kbd>, and <kbd>reduce</kbd>.</p>
<p>Because of this, the principles they already know are covered in modules 2 and 3. Abilities that make Erlang different from other languages are covered in modules 4 and 5.</p>
<p>Module 6 is a small project, not to exceed three hours of work-time, that the students are to conceptualize and code. You will encourage them to pick something they are interested in that uses all or almost all of the information they have learned from the previous modules.</p>
<p>Module 7 is a self-reflective and meta-cognative activity where the students are required to write a couple of paragraphs about what they consider to be indicators of good, reliable, online sources of information for the Erlang language versus those that are not.</p>
<h2>Instructor Role</h2>
<p>
	For this course, you are to act as a tutor and mentor. You will have no code or writing to grade, so most of your contract time is to be spent reaching out to individual students, giving them feedback on their code <em>as they write it</em>. This formative feedback will be much more helpful to them than summative feedback you could give after they have completed their weekly task. This feedback requirement does not imply that you should write the code for them, you could give them key-words to search for on the internet, provide alternative approaches to help them avoid pitfalls, and other behaviors of a good team-lead in industry.
</p>
<p>
	Be proactive, rather than reactive, to students and their needs. Become part of their team rather than a judge and jury deciding their fate.
</p>
<p>
	With this role in mind, you will find there are no submitted assignments and no grades you give as these types of things lead to summative rather than formative feedback.
</p>
<p>
	This is a pass/fail 1 credit course designed to be low stress and pressure. Be supportive of the students to the best of your ability.
</p>
<h2>Student Time</h2>
<p>All your students&rsquo; tasks for each week are to be done in teams and are designed to take a team 3-4 hours/week to complete. Therefore, teams must find time to work together to complete their tasks. You should encourage your students to begin working on their tasks at the beginning of each week and definitely discourage them from waiting until the task is due. That way they can ask more effective questions of you and have code you can advise them on.</p>
<h2>Weekly Pattern</h2>
<p>
	You have two hours of student time each module that are 'class time.' For the first, create one of more 10 minute videos regarding the topics for the module. Remember, this isn&rsquo;t an introductory course so you shouldn&rsquo;t be introducing basic concepts like variables, functions, etc.
</p>
<p>
	These videos are to reflect your experience in industry. That way the students will begin to get to know and trust you. Therefore they will be more willing to let you into their task completion process and listen to your feedback.
</p>
<p>
	These videos should be more than watching you code something, though that can be a portion of the videos. Again, think of yourself as a team lead and create videos in that role.
</p>

<p>
	Create one or more videos for the beginning of the week. Then, for the second hour, you are to create one or more videos that cover questions and issues the students in your class appear to generally still have.
</p>


<h2>Grades</h2>
<p>
	Each week, students will indicate their understanding of the material (see the weekly quizzes for the wording of this statement of understanding). If you notice a discrepancy between the claims of understanding and what you determine to be the understanding of the student via your interactions with them, reach out to the student <em>early</em> rather than waiting until the end of the block. Try to understand their perspective and help them to understand what will be expected of them later with regard to the language.
</p>

<p>The BYUI and Church culture of humility sometimes precludes students from rightfully claiming their excellent understanding. Help students understand their worth and develop their ability to understand and describe themselves while accepting responsibility for their learning.</p>
<p>Historically, it has been rare that a student will claim a higher understanding than is correct. If this is the case, tell them what you think, what you have observed of them, and why some other claim may be correct. Do not &lsquo;give&rsquo; them a grade. Ask them if your understanding is correct. Due to a perceived power differential, your students usually defer to you, so make sure they are comfortable with the understanding description you have selected.</p>
<h3>Helping Non-Interactive Students</h3>
<p>
	If you notice, using the iLearn tools, that a student is not spending what appears to be the time required to view the videos and complete the tasks, reach out to them. Contact them so they don't become lost sheep.
</p>
<p>
	Discuss team dynamics with them. Find out if they are working with and meeting with a team. This alone often helps them to more fully engage in the material. Make sure they are doing actual team work, not just sitting together doing individual work.
