        <h2>Week 05 Goals</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Introduce stateful processes and how Erlang keeps track of state.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Before the Week Begins</h2>
        <h3>Inspire Your Students</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Share an insight from a scripture or a general conference talk.
                <ul>
                    <li>You can be a great role model for students about what it means to study the gospel and apply it to your own life. During this lesson, consider making a video or sending a class-wide email highlighting an insight from a general conference talk or the scriptures and how it applies to your life.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Consider sharing a gospel insight on how you have applied gospel principles in your career.</li>
            <li>Discuss what you think are the most difficult part of the reading for students to understand or expound on anything you think would be helpful to the students.</li>
            <li>Consider sharing an example of how you used concepts from this week in your own profession. Perhaps the experience can be related to a programming challenge you or a team had to resolve.</li>
        </ul>



        <h2>During the Week</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitor the Microsoft Teams channels. Interacting with students is where much of your time should be spent. You may consider reaching out to those students who appear not to be regularly participating.</li>

            <li>Create and make available one or more 10 minute videos relative to the goals of this module.
            </li>

            <li>
                Reach out to any students in the class that appear to have 'gone dark.'
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Grading and Feedback</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Since there are no graded assignments in this course, you will need to be proactive in reviewing and providing constructive feedback on students' tasks. (See the <a class="inline_disabled" href="general.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Teaching Notes</a>.) Check the results from the W04 Quiz with the Tasks to determine if any students who completed the quiz did not turn in a task submission. If students do not submit their tasks but receive points from the quiz, you should reach out to them to ask for the submission so you can check their understanding. You are allowed to remove their quiz points if they do not respond to you or refuse to submit the task for review and feedback.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Create and post your announcement for W06 by Friday (mountain time) at the end of the week.</li>
            <li>Let students know you will frequently provide feedback on their task submissions. These assignments are not graded; however, students will receive personalized instruction and feedback from you.</li>
            <li>Your announcement should include a reference to gospel principles or topics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sample W06 Announcement</h3>
        <div class="txtbox"><b>Week 05 Wrap Up - Release Friday</b><br />
            <p>Dear Erlang Students,</p>
            <p>It's time to start working on your final project! You'll have until the end of Week 6 to complete it. The Week 6 Reading will give you ideas. You are welcome to choose one of the ideas from the list or to come up with your own idea. The most important thing about the final project is that you have fun and learn as you apply Erlang to solve a specific problem.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Don't overthink it. This project should be something that will take you about 3 hours to complete. Focus on getting something working first, then continue to add to it as you have time.</p>
            <p>Do your best and submit what you have at the end of the week. As part of the submission, you'll need to c<span>reate a short video screencast demonstration showing how your code works and how to run it.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>I hope you have a great learning experience as you complete the project. Remember to use other resources to help you, such as the documentation and tutorials at <a href="https://www.erlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.erlang.org/</a> and the book "l<a class="inline_disabled" href="https://learnyousomeerlang.com/content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earn you some Erlang for great good</a>". Use Google or ChatGPT to help you brainstorm ideas and to explore different approaches for your project. You should stretch yourself just a little bit by learning something new as you complete the project. At the end, the goal is to have a working program that does something interesting or helpful to you.</p>
            <p>Feel free to reach out with questions or to discuss possible ideas with me.</p>
