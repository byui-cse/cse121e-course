        <h2>Week 04 Goals</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Introduce concurrency and the Erlang syntax and BIFs that make this possible and easy.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Before the Week Begins</h2>
        <h3>Inspire Your Students</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Share an insight from a scripture or a general conference talk.
                <ul>
                    <li>You can be a great role model for students about what it means to study the gospel and apply it to your own life. During this lesson, consider making a video or sending a class-wide email highlighting an insight from a general conference talk or the scriptures and how it applies to your life.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Consider sharing a gospel insight on how you have applied gospel principles in your career.</li>
            <li>Discuss what you think are the most difficult part of the reading for students to understand or expound on anything you think would be helpful to the students.</li>
            <li>Consider sharing an example of how you used concepts from this week in your own profession. Perhaps the experience can be related to a programming challenge you or a team had to resolve.</li>
        </ul>



        <h2>During the Week</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitor the Microsoft Teams channels. Interacting with students is where much of your time should be spent. You may consider reaching out to those students who appear not to be regularly participating.</li>

            <li>Create and make available one or more 10 minute videos relative to the goals of this module.
            </li>

            <li>
                Reach out to any students in the class that appear to have 'gone dark.'
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Grading and Feedback</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Since there are no graded assignments in this course, you will need to be proactive in reviewing and providing constructive feedback on students' tasks. (See the <a class="inline_disabled" href="general.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Teaching Notes</a>.) Check the results from the W03 Quiz with the Tasks to determine if any students who completed the quiz did not turn in a task submission. If students do not submit their tasks but receive points from the quiz, you should reach out to them to ask for the submission so you can check their understanding. You are allowed to remove their quiz points if they do not respond to you or refuse to submit the task for review and feedback.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Create and post your announcement for W05 by Friday (mountain time) at the end of the week.</li>
            <li>Let students know you will frequently provide feedback on their task submissions. These assignments are not graded; however, students will receive personalized instruction and feedback from you.</li>
            <li>Your announcement should include a reference to gospel principles or topics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sample W05 Announcement</h3>
        <div class="txtbox"><b>Week 04 Wrap Up - Release Friday</b><br />
            <p>Dear Erlang Students,</p>
            <p>This last week we've been learning how to spawn processes and send messages between processes. If you're encountering any questions or difficulty with understanding the reading material or the weekly task, I would encourage you to look for additional resources to help you learn. In addition to the documentation and tutorials available at <a href="https://www.erlang.org/," target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.erlang.org/,</a> I also recommend looking at the free online book "<a class="inline_disabled" href="https://learnyousomeerlang.com/content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learn you some Erlang for great good!</a>". This is an excellent resource with more examples of how to use Erlang, in an easy to read format.</p>
            <p>For Week 05, we'll be continuing with the concept of message passing and spawning processes, but we'll also add the concept of maintaining state. Think of "state" as all the things the program needs to remember or keep track of. Erlang has an interesting way of maintaining state throughout the lifecycle of a process. As you do the reading, make sure to try out the example code and play with it until you understand it.</p>
            <h3>Final Project</h3>
            <p>You should start thinking about a potential final project, which will be due in two weeks. For a lookahead, see the Week 06 Task. This will give you some ideas of projects you might consider. Remember, the final project is required in order to pass this course. If you have an idea you would like to run by me, feel free to send me a message on Teams or by email.</p>
