        <h2>Week 03 Goals</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Introduce modules</li>
            <li>Introduce the structure of Erlang functions, including clauses, etc.</li>
            <li>Introduce guards.</li>
            <li>Introduce Erlang list processing.</li>
            <li>Introduce the Erlang syntax for <kbd>map</kbd>, <kbd>filter</kbd>, and <kbd>reduce</kbd>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Before the Week Begins</h2>
        <h3>Inspire Your Students</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Share an insight from a scripture or a general conference talk.
                <ul>
                    <li>You can be a great role model for students about what it means to study the gospel and apply it to your own life. During this lesson, consider making a video or sending a class-wide email highlighting an insight from a general conference talk or the scriptures and how it applies to your life.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Consider sharing a gospel insight on how you have applied gospel principles in your career.</li>
            <li>Discuss what you think are the most difficult part of the reading for students to understand or expound on anything you think would be helpful to the students.</li>
            <li>Consider sharing an example of how you used concepts from this week in your own profession. Perhaps the experience can be related to a programming challenge you or a team had to resolve.</li>
        </ul>



        <h2>During the Week</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitor the Microsoft Teams channels. Interacting with students is where much of your time should be spent. You may consider reaching out to those students who appear not to be regularly participating.</li>

            <li>Create and make available one or more 10 minute videos relative to the goals of this module.
            </li>

            <li>
                Reach out to any students in the class that appear to have 'gone dark.'
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Grading and Feedback</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Since there are no graded assignments in this course, you will need to be proactive in reviewing and providing constructive feedback on students' tasks. (See the <a class="inline_disabled" href="general.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Teaching Notes</a>.) Check the results from the W02 Quiz with the Tasks to determine if any students who completed the quiz did not turn in a task submission. If students do not submit their tasks but receive points from the quiz, you should reach out to them to ask for the submission so you can check their understanding. You are allowed to remove their quiz points if they do not respond to you or refuse to submit the task for review and feedback.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Create and post your announcement for W04 by Friday (mountain time) at the end of the week.</li>
            <li>Let students know you will frequently provide feedback on their task submissions. These assignments are not graded; however, students will receive personalized instruction and feedback from you.</li>
            <li>Your announcement should include a reference to gospel principles or topics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sample W04 Announcement</h3>
        <div class="txtbox"><b>Week 03 Wrap Up - Release Friday</b><br />
            <p>Dear CSE 121E Students,</p>
            <p>First of all, make sure to take a look at the sample solution for the weekly task after you finish it so you can see another approach. There is a video included to walk through the sample solution, so you can use that to help you understand if you get stuck.</p>
            <p>Over the last week we've learned how to create and use functions in Erlang. The way we've been writing functions works great for single-threaded sequential programs. However, one of the most powerful features of Erlang is its support for writing concurrent programs. This next week we will begin learning the Erlang way of writing code that can easily spawn multiple processes, making concurrent programs relatively easy to write.</p>
            <p>If you are not familiar with the concept of spawning a process or writing concurrent code in another language, I would encourage you to do a little research before reading about how to do it in Erlang. You might try using Google to search for topics such as "what is concurrency" and "parallelism vs concurrency".</p>
            <p>You could also try using a generative AI tool such as ChatGPT to learn about concurrency. Try prompting ChatGPT with something like "<span>I am a student who is learning to program in erlang. What does concurrency mean and why would I want to use erlang to write concurrent programs?"</span></p>
            <p><span>Then read the response and ask additional questions to help you dig deeper into the topic.</span></p>
            <p><span>I want to let you all know that I am here to help you if you get stuck or have questions. Most of the groups have been doing an outstanding job of meeting together, working on the task together, and helping one another with questions. I've been very impressed with how well you have been using your groups to help each other. Keep up the great dialog with one another!</span></p>
